<h1>About</h1>
<p id="about">First and foremost this site contains posts that are related to my work as a software developer/architect.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p id="work">I&rsquo;ve been developing software in some form or other since the turn of the millennium. During that time I&rsquo;ve had a chance to work with a wide variety of technologies, in many different business domains.</p>
<p>Most of my career has been as an in-house architect/developer.
I consider myself to be a &ldquo;full-stack&rdquo; developer. But my main responsibilities have typically been architecture and development on the server-side of things.</p>
<p>As the years have gone by, my frustrations with Java and its extremely verbose and convoluted ways have grown more and more. Then, a few years ago, i discovered <a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> and functional programming. Since then I&rsquo;ve fallen deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. These days, when I write code, I prefer Scala. A language that I&rsquo;ve grown to like quite a lot&hellip;warts and all. It has even brought back the fun in writing client side code, thanks to <a href="http://scala-js.org">Scala.js</a>.</p>
<h2>Private</h2>
<p id="private">I have three girls living under my roof. A wonderful wife and two sweet daughters. At least two of them are quite good at ensuring I don&rsquo;t get enough sleep. I&rsquo;ve given up on the chance of ever having a full bodied head of hair again.</p>
<p>When time and energy allows, I try to squeeze in some game time on my PS4.</p>
<p>I like climbing&hellip;bouldering to be more specific. It allows me to spend time outdoors and stay fit at the same time. Fresh air and physical activity is the best medicine to revitalize both mind and body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now&hellip;</p>
