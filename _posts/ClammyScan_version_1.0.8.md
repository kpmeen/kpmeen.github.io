The Play! Framwork is moving along in a steady pace. One of the key changes since the previous 2.4.x releases, is the move from the Iteratee library to akka-stream. So to make sure ClammyScan will work with play 2.5.x and future releases, it has now been completely re-written. The current version is available on maven central and on [github](https://github.com/kpmeen/clammyscan).
