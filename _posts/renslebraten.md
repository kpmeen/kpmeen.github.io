A while back I promised my wife a new and improved web site. The hardest part, as always, was to come up with a good concept for the UI. In this case we wanted something that would give a little glimpse into her mind and imagination. Something that would reflect her. And I think the [end result](http://renslebraten.no) achieves that.

For me, mostly having spent time focusing on the backend side of things, this was an adventure into topics I have been wanting to explore for quite some time. Specially the many fun "new" features of CSS, which I find fascinating.

This project was also the main driver behind writing the ["Blaarg!"](http://scalytica.net/#posts/2016-04-04/Blaargh) template, that also this site is based on. In addition to being a template, "Blaargh!" provides mechanisms for producing, rendering and publishing blog posts/articles from markdown. Much like Jekyll...but with Scala instead. The main motivation behind these was to have a way for my wife be able to easily publish new content. Without my help or having to learn all sorts of command line voodoo magic.

My wife is very happy with the new site, and that makes me happy too.
