<p>As couple of weeks ago, as part of another project to be disclosed in a few days, I decided it was time to freshen up the way this site looks. And I wanted to do it in a way that allowed me to try out a few things. One of them being <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/Ammonite/">Ammonite</a> by Li Haoyi. I also wanted to create the site using <a href="http://scala-js.org">scala-js</a> which is the main reason I have started fiddling with front-end stuff again. Specifically, the client is based on the excellent <a href="https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react">scalajs-react</a> library. For me, scala-js has brought back the fun of writing client side code.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to jot down how this all works. I&rsquo;ll save that for the template documentation (which is a bit lacking at the moment&hellip;but it&rsquo;s coming). Also, it&rsquo;s still evolving as I find new things I want to add or improve.</p>
<h3>Where can I find this template?</h3>
<p id="where-can-i-find-this-template">This site is now using the new &ldquo;Blaargh!&rdquo; template. But if you want to have a look at the source it can be found <a href="https://github.com/kpmeen/blaargh">here</a>. There&rsquo;s also a  <a href="https://scalytica.net/blaargh">demo</a> of what the raw template looks like.
<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="posts/BlaarghScreenShot.png" alt="Blaargh! demo screen shot" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px;"/>
</div></p>
