<p>As couple of weeks ago, as part of another project to be disclosed in a few days, I decided it was time to freshen up the way this site looks. And I wanted to do it in a way that allowed me to try out a few things. One of them being <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/Ammonite/">Ammonite</a> by Li Haoyi. I also wanted to create the site using <a href="http://scala-js.org">scala-js</a> which is the main reason I have started fiddling with front-end stuff again. Specifically, the client is based on the excellent <a href="https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react">scalajs-react</a> library. For me, scala-js has brought back the fun of writing client side code.</p>
<p>I'm not going to jot down how this all works. I'll save that for the template documentation (which is a bit lacking at the moment...but it's coming). Also, it's still evolving as I find new things I want to add or improve.</p><h3 id="where - can - i - find - this - template">Where can I find this template?</h3>
<p>This site is now using the new "Blaargh!" template. But if you want to have a look at the source it can be found <a href="https://github.com/kpmeen/blaargh">here</a>. There's also a <a href="http://scalytica.net/blaargh">demo</a> of what the raw template looks like. <div style="text-align: center"><img src="posts/BlaarghScreenShot.png" alt="Blaargh! demo screen shot" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px" /></div></p><h3 id="can - i - use - and - modify - it">Can I use and modify it?</h3>
<p>Sure, go ahead! Clone the repository, make changes and do with it as you please. It's all published under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache v2 license</a>.</p>
