<p>A while back I promised my wife a new and improved web site. The hardest part, as always, was to come up with a good concept for the UI. In this case we wanted something that would give a little glimpse into her mind and imagination. Something that would reflect her. And I think the <a href="http://renslebraten.no">end result</a> achieves that.</p>
<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="posts/renslebraten-screen.png" alt="renslebraten-screen" title="Sceenshot of renslebraten.no" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 500px" /></div></p>
<p>For me, mostly having spent time focusing on the backend side of things, this was an adventure into topics I have been wanting to explore for quite some time. Specially the many fun "new" features of CSS, which I find fascinating.</p>
<p>This project was also the main driver behind writing the <a href="http://scalytica.net/#posts/2016-04-04/Blaargh">"Blaarg!"</a> template, that also this site is based on. In addition to being a template, "Blaargh!" provides mechanisms for producing, rendering and publishing blog posts/articles from markdown. Much like Jekyll...but with Scala instead. The main motivation behind these was to have a way for my wife be able to easily publish new content. Without my help or having to learn all sorts of command line voodoo magic.</p>
<p>My wife is very happy with the new site, and that makes me happy too.</p>
