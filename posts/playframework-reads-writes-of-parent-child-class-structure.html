<p>The built-in JSON (de-)serialization mechanisms in the playframework are really powerful.
But they have a couple of shortcomings. One of which is being able to (de-)serialize a trait or an abstract class as the correct child implementation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come across this scenario a couple of times now. Each time I&rsquo;ve tried all sorts of different approaches. However, I keep falling back to this pattern based on <a href="https://gist.github.com/mandubian/8955241">a gist by @mandubian</a>.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p id="the-problem">Say we have the following simple representation of Animals</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">trait Animal
case class Cat(name: String) extends Animal
case class Dog(name: String) extends Animal
</code></pre>
<p>If we now want need to expose Cats and Dogs as JSON, we would typically implement an implicit Reads and Writes for those case classes. A common pattern is to do this in the companion objects.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">object Cat {
  implicit val r: Reads[Cat] = Json.reads[Cat]
  implicit val w: Writes[Cat] = Json.writes[Cat]
}

object Dog {
  implicit val r: Reads[Dog] = Json.reads[Dog]
  implicit val w: Writes[Dog] = Json.writes[Dog]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say we want to create a case class for <code>PetOwner</code> that contains a list of owned pets.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">case class PetOwner(name: String, pets: List[Animal])

object PetOwner {
  implicit val r: Reads[PetOwner] = Json.reads[PetOwner]
  implicit val w: Writes[PetOwner] = Json.writes[PetOwner]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course we would also like to be able to (de-)serialize this class from/to JSON. This is where the trouble begins. Typically you will get this type of error:</p>
<pre><code>No implicit Reads for List[Animal] available.
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>No implicit Writes for List[Animal] available.
</code></pre>
<p>Because we are in the world of JSON, there is little to no information for the (de-)serialization mechanism to know which child type of Animal it should resolve to.</p>
<h2>A solution</h2>
<p id="a-solution">To help resolve the JSON to the correct type we introduce a &ldquo;discriminator&rdquo; attribute (I&rsquo;ve called it <code>val $tpe = &quot;$type&quot;</code> here). This is basically a String value that identifies each child type of Animal.
For the <code>Reads[Animal]</code> implementation we can then look for the &ldquo;$type&rdquo; key in the JSON message. And based on the value, we can explicitly use the reads defined for each child.
A similar approach can be done for <code>Writes[Animal]</code>. Only here we do a pattern match on the child type, and for each of them we explicitly invoke its OWrites function <code>Cat.w.writes(...)</code>. Then we append a JsObject with the $tpe attribute <code>Json.obj($tpe -&gt; catClsName)</code> to ensure each Animal JSON contains which animal type it represents.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">object Animal {
  private val $tpe = &quot;$type&quot;
  private val catClsName = classOf[Cat].getSimpleName
  private val dogClsName = classOf[Dog].getSimpleName

  implicit val reads: Reads[Animal] = Reads { jsv =&gt;
    (jsv \ $tpe).as[String] match {
      case `catClsName` =&gt; JsSuccess(jsv.as(Cat.r))
      case `dogClsName` =&gt; JsSuccess(jsv.as(Dog.r))
      case err: String =&gt; JsError(s&quot;Not a supported Animal type $err&quot;)
    }
  }
  implicit val writes: Writes[Animal] = Writes {
    case mf: Cat =&gt; Cat.w.writes(mf).as[JsObject] ++ Json.obj($tpe -&gt; catClsName)
    case yf: Dog =&gt; Dog.w.writes(yf).as[JsObject] ++ Json.obj($tpe -&gt; dogClsName)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We are now able to read and write JSON correctly from our PetOwner class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">val owner = PetOwner(&quot;John&quot;, List(Cat(&quot;Garfield&quot;), Dog(&quot;Odie&quot;)))
val ownerJson = Json.toJson[PetOwner](owner)
</code></pre>
<p>produces:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;John&quot;,
  &quot;pets&quot; : [ {
    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Garfield&quot;,
    &quot;$type&quot; : &quot;Cat&quot;
  }, {
    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Odie&quot;,
    &quot;$type&quot; : &quot;Dog&quot;
  } ]
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p id="summary">This pattern does solve the problem. However it is a bit fiddly having to manipulate the parent companion object every time a new child implementation is needed. If someone has a better solution to this, I am very interested to hear about it.</p>
