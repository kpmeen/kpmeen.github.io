<p>Recently I had to figure out a solution to ensure files being uploaded were scanned by an AV scanner. After a day or so of research (google), I were not able to find any existing libraries that would do what I needed with the technology stack I am using (Scala, Play framework and MongoDB with ReactiveMongo, ++). There are, of course, some Java based implementations for scanning files using the input stream functionality in ClamAV. But they are typically;</p>
<ul>
  <li>a) Written in Java (and typically for a JEE stack) and very verbose (which would be fair enough if it wasn't for b)</li>
  <li>b) Blocking execution and buffering the file before streaming it to ClamAV</li>
</ul>
<p>Which led me to just write my own implementation, hereby known as "ClammyScan". It's a simple library taking advantage of the powerful composability of the BodyParser implementations in Play. At the current time of writing there are 3 different ones. Which are all extensions of the standard multipart form data parser found in Play.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The simplest one will just scan a file and return the result.</li>
  <li>Another one behaves more or less the same way as the default parser, except it will send the stream to a running clamd process in parallel with creating a temporary file.</li>
  <li>The third is a customizable body parser that accepts an Iteratee that can do whatever you specify with the stream at the same time as it's scanned by clamd.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both 1) and 2) above, the file is removed immediately if infected (default), and a suitable response is sent back as a JSON message to the client that was uploading the file.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you should find yourself in need of something similar. You can check out ClammyScan in the <a href="https://github.com/scalytica/clammyscan">github repository</a>. If you have any feature, improvement or other suggestions, please feel free to contribute or create an issue in the github issue tracker.</p>
